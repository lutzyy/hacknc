# PhotoSketchTaggerApp

This is a simple Android app that allows a user to draw sketches with their finger and save those sketches to a local SQL database with some comma-delimited tags. They can then search by tag to locate certain sketches. Users can do the same with photos they take, which are saved in a distinct table in the same database.
