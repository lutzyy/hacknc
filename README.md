## Project Description:

Beight is an Android app developed for HackNC 2023, designed to enhance patient safety by preventing the misdiagnosis of diseases. Our app leverages doctor directed usage of our user-selected medical symptoms to provide real-time guidance, and alerts to ensure that commonly misdiagnosed diseases are discovered and dangerous medications related to these diseases are not taken.

## Features:
- Based on doctor-identified base conditions, our app narrows down the possibilities for doctors and nurses to save them time, and keep patients safe from accidental diagnosis.
- User-friendly interface for inputting medical conditions.
- Identification of dangerous medications related to commonly misdiagnosed diseases.
- Additional resources and information on medication safety.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/lutzyy/hacknc.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

4. Start exploring the features to see how Beight enhances patient safety.

- Android Studio
- Java
- SQLite (for medication and condition database)
